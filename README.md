# list

Based on Udemy course "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2022)", chapter 24, this app is created to enable users to print a list of their file names in the window terminal in any specific directory. 

As part of learning experience, this app covers the topic on the basics of nodeJS (how to set up nodeJS, key CLI, nodeJS APIs) and how to create a package.json and its important features such as dependencies, bin and script.
"bin" allows devs to create a shortcut link to their files.
